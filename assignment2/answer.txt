1.	pthread_thing_operation(..) (PTHREADS(7))

2.	mutexes - Mutual exclusion lock: Block access to variables by other threads. This enforces exclusive access by a thread to a 	variable or set of variables.
	joins - Make a thread wait till others are complete (terminated).
	condition variables - data type pthread_cond_t
	(PTHREAD_JOIN(3),PTHREADS(7))

3.	To avoid spurious wakeups, since the return from pthread_cond_timedwait() or pthread_cond_wait() does not imply anything about the value of this predicate, the predicate should be re-evaluated upon such return.(PTHREAD_COND_WAIT(3))

4.	Suppose thread A wakes up thread B.
	For Hansen-style(Java, Linux pthread and other OSes), A will continue executing. After A release the lock, execute B. 
	For Hoare-style, B will excute next and thread A sleep. After B finished, A continue executing.
	(SIGNAL(7),SIGNAL(2))

5.	When the condition variable is blocked, it only can be signaled by another thread, but holding two mutexes will also block execute of other threads. thus causes deadlock.(PTHREAD_COND_WAIT(3))

6.	The detached thread cannot be joined back once detached. The pthread_detach() function marks the thread identified by thread as detached.When a detached thread terminates, its resources are automatically released back to the system without the need for another thread to join with the terminated thread.(PTHREAD_DETACH(3))
